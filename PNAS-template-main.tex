Recent work has shown that by considering it as a network and focusing on the network properties might shed light on this mystery. Moreover, we can employ the machinery from mathematics and physics to understand the mechanisms driving this most advanced product of the natural selection as well as the origins of consciousness. }

\begin{abstract}
The network science has proven to be an exceptional tool for modeling and analyzing the real world systems in the past couple of decades. Among all the complex systems, the neural system has it's own unique corner in terms of it's self referencing nature due to the functional complexity of it. There is a caveat here by Godel, a famous mathematician, logician and philosopher, stating that it might not be possible to fully resolve the mysteries of a formal system for an observer inside of the system meaning that we are trying to understand the brain via our brain again. Is brain really that complex that it is able to understand it's own complexity? We don't know the answer yet, since we are far from understanding the all capabilities of the brain at the moment. However, this doesn't mean that we are not going to expand the frontiers as much as we can in neuroscience. With this motivation in mind, we want to combine the knowledge from a well-studied branch of mathematics, algebraic topology and persistent homology in particular is going to be the main tool we are employing. We start by comparing the evolution of the clique structures in a structural brain network with the resting state functional brain network.

\dropcap{I}t has been known that the human brain network has scale free topology, meaning that it's degree distribution is given by the controversial power law. Moreover, varying types of network measures, modularity, distribution of motif and hub structures can provide us meaningful information about the way this complex system works. One particular problem with the large brain networks is making associations between the structure and the function of the interactions between brain regions. In a large scale brain network, nodes are described by brain regions in the cortical and subcortical areas. In a structural brain network, the relations between the nodes are defined by white matter tracts which are obtained by BOLD signals. On the other hand, in a functional brain network, links are given by the magnitudes of functional correlations in activity. Thus, before making any sort of analysis, one should be cautious about the assumptions they are making because the way we analyze the brain via network science depends completely on the network that we want to choose since the nature of the connections are derived from different choices. Reader should have came to the awareness of this ambiguity at this point. For this to end, the main purpose of this work is trying to reduce this indefiniteness, and compare these two types of networks in terms of lower connectivity regions which we elaborate more and come up with a mapping if possible.

  In network theory, a k-clique is the subset of nodes in which every node is connected to k-1 others among the subset. A converse to this concept would be fully disconnected set of nodes. However, we are assuming our networks has one connected component. So, a partial converse can be defined as a hole, or a loop, in a network which can be thought of as removing some number of edges from the clique without changing the number of connected components. These regions in the brain networks can be characterized by a low connectivity region meaning that this part of the work does not completely shut down but works in a lower capacity, whereas a region without a hole, consisting of a clique is a stronger connectivity region in which every node of the network compounding the clique considered as engaging in the process of whatever the network does. It is shown that these lower connectivity regions might actually be responsible from resting-state dynamics, cognitive control and correlated network states(cite).

Several attempts have been made to uncover this problem(cite) which are mostly rely on thresholding with respect to different scales... So, the problem with this approach is that thresholding value is decided by a user which most of the time ends up over looking the lower connectivity regions. In this work, we are employing a method which goes through every value of a range of finely divided thresholding values while keeping track of the information at each scale. 



\section*{Guide to using this template on Overleaf}

Please note that whilst this template provides a preview of the typeset manuscript for submission, to help in this preparation, it will not necessarily be the final publication layout. For more detailed information please see the \href{http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/format.xhtml}{PNAS Information for Authors}.

If you have a question while using this template on Overleaf, please use the help menu (``?'') on the top bar to search for \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help}{help and tutorials}. You can also \href{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}{contact the Overleaf support team} at any time with specific questions about your manuscript or feedback on the template.

\subsection*{Author Affiliations}

Include department, institution, and complete address, with the ZIP/postal code, for each author. Use lower case letters to match authors with institutions, as shown in the example. Authors with an ORCID ID may supply this information at submission.

\subsection*{Submitting Manuscripts}

All authors must submit their articles at \href{http://www.pnascentral.org/cgi-bin/main.plex}{PNAScentral}. If you are using Overleaf to write your article, you can use the ``Submit to PNAS'' option in the top bar of the editor window. 

\subsection*{Format}

Many authors find it useful to organize their manuscripts with the following order of sections;  Title, Author Affiliation, Keywords, Abstract, Significance Statement, Results, Discussion, Materials and methods, Acknowledgments, and References. Other orders and headings are permitted.

\subsection*{Manuscript Length}

PNAS generally uses a two-column format averaging 67 characters, including spaces, per line. The maximum length of a Direct Submission research article is six pages and a Direct Submission Plus research article is ten pages including all text, spaces, and the number of characters displaced by figures, tables, and equations.  When submitting tables, figures, and/or equations in addition to text, keep the text for your manuscript under 39,000 characters (including spaces) for Direct Submissions and 72,000 characters (including spaces) for Direct Submission Plus.

\subsection*{References}

References should be cited in numerical order as they appear in text; this will be done automatically via bibtex, e.g. \cite{belkin2002using} and \cite{berard1994embedding,coifman2005geometric}. All references should be included in the main manuscript file.  

\subsection*{Data Archival}

PNAS must be able to archive the data essential to a published article. Where such archiving is not possible, deposition of data in public databases, such as GenBank, ArrayExpress, Protein Data Bank, Unidata, and others outlined in the Information for Authors, is acceptable.

\subsection*{Language-Editing Services}
Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to use a language-editing service (see list at www.pnas.org/site/authors/language-editing.xhtml). PNAS does not take responsibility for or endorse these services, and their use has no bearing on acceptance of a manuscript for publication.

\end{SCfigure*}

\subsection*{Digital Figures}

Only TIFF, EPS, and high-resolution PDF for Mac or PC are allowed for figures that will appear in the main text, and images must be final size. Authors may submit U3D or PRC files for 3D images; these must be accompanied by 2D representations in TIFF, EPS, or high-resolution PDF format.  Color images must be in RGB (red, green, blue) mode. Include the font files for any text. 

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way using the \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| commands.

Figure \ref{fig:frog} shows an example of how to insert a column-wide figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment. Figures wider than one column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide. Use \verb|\begin{SCfigure*}...\end{SCfigure*}| for a wide figure with side captions.

\subsection*{Tables}
In addition to including your tables within this manuscript file, PNAS requires that each table be uploaded to the submission separately as a “Table” file.  Please ensure that each table .tex file contains a preamble, the \verb|\begin{document}| command, and the \verb|\end{document}| command. This is necessary so that the submission system can convert each file to PDF.

\subsection*{Single column equations}

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment mentioned above for figures.

Note that the use of the \verb|widetext| environment for equations is not recommended, and should not be used.
